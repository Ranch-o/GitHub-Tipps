    "Connecting a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) with your GitHub account and syncing changes involves a few steps. Assuming you have Git installed and your GitHub account is set up, here's a general process you can follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a Local Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, you need to create a local Git repository in the folder where your notebook is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Open Terminal or Command Prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Navigate to the directory where your notebook is located using cd path/to/your/notebook/folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initialize the repository by running git init.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Connect the Local Repository to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a new repository on GitHub. Go to GitHub, sign in, click on the \"+\" icon in the top right corner, and select \"New repository\".\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Clone the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "    First, you need to clone the repository to your local PC. This will create a copy of the repository on your local machine and automatically set up the remote tracking branches.\n",

    "    Copy code\n",
    "    git remote -v\n",
    "    This command should display the remote repository's URL for fetch and push operations, confirming that your local repository is linked to your GitHub account.\n",

    "4. Synchronize the Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "    Pull Changes: If there have been any updates to the remote repository since you cloned it, you can synchronize your local repository with the remote one by pulling the changes:\n",
